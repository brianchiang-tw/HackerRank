Qustion:

In a single toss of 2 fair six-sided dice, 
find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and the two dice have a sum of 6



Solution:

For 2 fair six-sided dice:

sum = 6:

    (5, 1) v
    (4, 2) v
    (3, 3) x
    (2, 4) v
    (1, 5) v

But the description demands having different values, so (3, 3) is invlid choice.

total combination for sum = 6 = 4

P ( sum = 6 ) = 4 / 36 = 1 / 9



Ans:

P ( sum = 6 ) = 1 / 9
