Qustion:

Suppoer a family has 2 children, one of which is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?


Solution:



    # Method_#1

For all possible cases of 2 children:

    (Boy, Boy)
    (Boy, Girl)
    (Girl, Boy)
    (Girl, Girl)

# Let the (Boy, Boy) as Event A
# Let the case of one of them is a boy as Event B

First, we have that P(B) 
= 1 - P( none of which is a boy ) 
= 1 - (1/2) * (1/2) 
= 1 - 1/4
= 3/4

Second, we can know that P( A ∩ B ) 
= P( Boy, Boy )
= 1/2 * 1/2
= 1/4

Finally, we know the conditional probability of P( A | B) 

P( A | B) 
= P( A ∩ B ) / P( B )

= (1/4) / (3/4)

= 1/3



    # Method_#2

For all possible cases of 2 children:

    (Boy, Boy)
    (Boy, Girl)
    (Girl, Boy)
    (Girl, Girl)

Under the condition of that one of which is Boy, we have

    (Boy, Boy)
    (Boy, Girl)
    (Girl, Boy)

Then compute the probability that both of two children are Boys

P( Boy, Boy | one of which is Boy ) = 1 / 3


Ans:

P( Boy, Boy | one of which is Boy ) 
= 1 / 3
