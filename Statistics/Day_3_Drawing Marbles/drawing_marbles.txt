Question:

A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles.
Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bad, at raondom, without replacement.
If the first marble drawan is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?


Solution:

# Let the result of first marble is red be Event A 
# Let the result of first marble is red and second marble be Event B



Initial state:

3 Red marbles
4 Blue marbles

P( A ) 
= 3 / ( 3 + 4 )
= 3 / 7

After drawing one red marble, it becomes as following:

2 Red marbles
4 Blue marbles

P( A ∩ B ) 
= 4 / ( 2 + 4 )
= 4 / 6
= 2 / 3

P( A | B )
= P( A ) = P( A ∩ B ) / P( B )

= [ ( 3 / 7 )*( 2 / 3 ) ] / ( 3 / 7)
= 2 / 3


Ans:

P( Red, Blue) = 2 / 3
